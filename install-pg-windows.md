# Install PostgreSQL on Windows

## Download the installer

There is an interactive installer for windows that will walk you through installation and setup.

Download the installer here: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/

## Installation and setup

> **IMPORTANT:** During installation and setup you will be prompted to create multiple new passwords for Postgres itself, for pgAdmin, and for postgres users. Make sure to save these passwords as they will be necessary for you to use Postgres.

- Run the installer
    + the default options should work
    + make sure that **pgAdmin** is installed in addition to the default options
- Once the installer is done, run **pgAdmin**
    + you can locate this application in your start menu
    + the first time you open the app, you will be prompted to create a "master password for pgAdmin" (note this down)
